+++
#### Battery Systems
Flight times range from 15-25 minutes for a single DJI quad battery...bring extras! 
+++
#### Propellers/Rotors
A rotor is simply an *airfoil*, like an airplane wing.
+++
#### Propellers/Rotors
It creates *lift* to overcome the *weight* of the aircraft
+++
#### Propellers/Rotors
*Bernoulli's Principle* states that as a fluid (like air) is accelerated, its pressure decreases. 
+++

#### Propellers/Rotors
Why is a rotary wing shaped the way it is?
![DJI Prop](images/dji-prop.jpg)
+++
#### Multirotor Flight
How does a multirotor UAV achieve directional flight?
+++
#### Multirotor Flight
First we need to know how the four forces interact to create motion in the three axes of flight.
+++
#### Multirotor flight
##### The Four Forces
- Lift |
- Weight |
- Thrust |
- Drag |
+++
#### Multirotor Flight
- To go **UP**:  
  - Lift > Weight | 
- To go **DOWN**:
  -  Weight > Lift | 
- To go **FORWARD**: 
  - Thrust > Drag |
- To **HOVER**: 
  - Lift = Weight and Thrust = Drag | 
+++
#### Multirotor Flight
##### Three axes of flight
- Pitch (nose up/down) |
- Roll (wings tilt left/right) |
- Yaw (nose moves left/right) |
+++

#### Multirotor Flight
##### Putting it together
![Flight video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkbkO3e0ev0?start=114)
+++
If the basis for multirotor flight is modulating the motors to achieve the desired result, just HOW does it know what to do? How does it know to correct for a wind gust?

### Flight Control and State Estimation Systems
- Autopilot/Flight Computer
- Inertial Measurement Units
- Accelerometer
- MEMS Gyroscopes
- Magnetometer
- Air data computers
- GPS/GNSS Navigation components
+++
#### Autopilot/Flight Computer
The *brain* of the drone, receiving information from various onboard sensors and control inputs from the remote controller, and translating them to adjustments to motor RPMs.
+++
#### Autopilot/Flight Computer
https://www.dronetrest.com/t/beginners-guide-to-drone-autopilots-flight-controllers-and-how-they-work/1380

Micro Electric Mechanical Systems
![MEMS Gyro Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwe6LEYF0j8)
+++
#### Obstacle Avoidance Sensors
Prevent the aircraft from colliding with nearby objects/terrain.  
@css[fragment](Use *ultrasonic* sensing %28echolocation%29) @css[fragment]( or *infrared* imaging {heat signatures})@css[fragment]( or *stereoscopic* imaging {3D parallax} to measure distance to nearby obstacles.)  
#### Magnetometer
A sensor that measures *magnetism*, including the Earth's magnetic field. Measurements from a *properly calibrated* magnetometer can be used as a compass.  
+++
#### Magnetometer
In a UAV, a magnetometer can measure the aircraft's *heading*, or its direction relative to magnetic North.  
+++
#### Magnetometer
Caution: Magnetometers suffer from *interference* caused by other electromagnetic devices  
+++
####  Air Data Computer
Measures physical properties of the atmosphere, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, air speed, and altitude.
+++
#### Air Data Computer
##### Barometer
Measures static air pressure, usually relative to the value measured at take off. A change in altitude corresponds to a proportional change in air pressure, and thus pressure readings may be used to calculate aircraft height AGL. 
+++ 
#### GPS/GNSS Navigation
A GPS/GNSS receiver and antenna calculates the aircraft's location and altitude through *trilateration* by measuring the *range* to a number of navigational satellites.
+++

#### GPS/GNSS Navigation
The *range* to a satellite is calculated from the propagation time of the satellite's transmission, which travels at the...
- Speed of light |
+++
#### GPS/GNSS Navigation
![GPS Trilateration](images/gps-trilat.png)
+++
#### GPS/GNSS Navigation
GNSS drives many functions of the autopilot, including return to home, waypoint navigation/flight planning, automated "no fly" areas, etc.
---
### Control/Communications Systems
The communications link for most small UAS systems consists of...
- Receiver and antenna on-board the UAV
- Transmitter and antenna on Remote Controller
- Ground control station (software/hardware)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
##### A generalized workflow 
@css[fragment](Control inputs from the *joysticks* are encoded as radio signals...)@css[fragment](and sent to the UAV...)@css[fragment](where the flight controller interprets them and adjusts power to the motors accordingly.)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
##### A generalized workflow 
@css[fragment](The UAV sends information about its position, status, and system health back to the controller...)@css[fragment](where it is interpreted and displayed on the control station screen)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
##### A generalized workflow 
@css[fragment](Additionally...an image transmission signal from the UAV camera is sent back to the controller for a first-person-view or FPV live feed)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
Communications are sent and received over the **2.4Ghz** and sometimes the **5.8Ghz** frequency ranges...@css[fragment](the same frequency range that **WiFi, bluetooth**, and many other consumer electronics operate in...)@css[fragment](**Interference** can be a real problem in crowded radio environments.)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
Selecting a *channel* to minimize interference can yield success in challenging situations. 
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems 
Wifi spectrum analyzer apps for Android/iOS can be useful in assessing the strength and busyness of 2.4Ghz/5.8Ghz channels
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
![Wifi Analyzer](images/wifi-analyzer.png)
+++
#### Control/Communications Systems
##### Range Considerations
The transmission range of a given UAS system may be affected by the following considerations...

### Imaging Systems
Comprised of...
- Camera/Imaging Sensor |
- Gimbals/Image Stabilization Elements |
- Control Element |
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics
![Digital Camera](images/digital_camera.jpg)
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Resolution
When referring to a digital camera, *resolution* is defined by the number of photosites/pixels that the sensor is comprised of.  
Typically referenced by megapixels (millions of pixels).
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Resolution
![UAS Table](images/uas_table.JPG)
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Sensor Size
The physical size of the sensor dictates the size of each pixel, and thus the quantity of light each pixel can collect. A larger sensor can collect more light than a smaller sensor, yielding reduced noise and higher image quality. 
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Sensor Size
![Sensor Sizes](images/Sensor-Sizes.png)
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Focal Length
The focal length of the camera's lens dictates the *field of view*. Many drone cameras have fixed focal lengths from 21mm-28mm. This is a wide angle focal length.  
  
For example the DJI Phantom 4 Pro has a focal length of 24mm, and a field of view of 84°.
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Focal Length
In practice, a wider field of view generates a larger image footprint at a fixed distance than a narrower field of view (longer focal length)...  
  
@css[fragment](But a longer focal length generates a smaller ground sampling distance, or GSD, which means increased ability to resolve features on the ground)  
  
@css[fragment](There are always tradeoffs!)
+++

#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure
Image *total exposure* is the total amount of light captured by the sensor for a particular image. It is controlled by three main factors:
- Shutter Speed: How long the shutter stays open
- Aperture: The size of the opening in the lens through which light may pass
- Sensitivity: The "gain" setting of the sensor
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure 
*Shutter speed* is expressed as the fraction of a second (i.e. 1/60) during which the shutter is open.  
Higher shutter speeds are necessary to freeze motion and prevent blurring. 1/500 is a safe selection for stopping motion.
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure
*Aperture* is expressed as an *f-stop* number, with smaller numbers (i.e. f1.8) being larger than smaller numbers (i.e. f16).  Aperture also control *depth of field* or the area in the image that is in focus.
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure
![Aperture](images/aperture.jpg)
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure
*Sensitivity*, or *ISO* (formerly called *film speed*) is expressed as an *ISO number* (i.e. ISO 100, ISO 800, etc).  
A higher ISO number increases the sensitivity of the sensor to capture more light, but also increases the amount of *noise*, reducing image quality. 
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Camera Basics: Exposure
![iso](images/iso.jpg)
+++
#### Imaging Systems
##### Gimbals/Image Stablilization
A *gimbal* is a gyroscopic device that stabilizes a camera/sensor upon one or more of the axes of motion.
IMUs measure changes in orientation, and brushless motors adjust the camera to counteract the motion.
