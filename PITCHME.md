### Mapping applications of small UAS
- Aerial Photography/Orthomosaics
- Topographic Mapping/Digital Terrain Modelling
- Photogrammetry/Volumetric Survey
- IR/Thermal analysis
- Vegetation mapping
+++
### Mapping applications of small UAS
- Structure from Motion (SfM) image processing
 - 3D reconstruction based on point matching between overlapping images
 - Same principle as stereoscopic imagery
  - **parallax**: displacement of an object caused by a change in the point of observation
+++
![parallax](images/parallax.jpg)
+++
### Mapping applications of small UAS
- Generalized processing steps:
  1. Feature detection/image matching
  2. Point cloud generation
  3. Ground Control Point (GCP) specification (optional)
  4. Point cloud densification
  5. Mesh generation
  6. Orthomosaic/Digital Surface Model Generation

@title[Perryville Battlefield Mapping Project]
### Perryville Battlefield Mapping
###### Interdisciplinary Research Project
- Collaboration with Dr. Daniel Krebs (History Dept)
- Broad Objective: Using geospatial technology to map, model, analyze, and interpret the Civil War battle of Perryville
- Funding through the Commonwealth Center for Humanities and Society
+++
### Perryville Battlefield Mapping
- Multiple components: 
 - Georeferencing historic maps |
 - Interpreting and capturing spatial data from historic texts |
 - Time series analysis to model and interpret progression of troops during battle |
 - Terrain analysis to understand impact of topography on tactical advantages for Confederate Army |
+++
### Perryville Battlefield Mapping
###### Background Information
- October 8th, 1862
- Confederate General Braxton Bragg makes camp with his army on Doctor's Creek near Perryville
- Union Army, led by Gen. Don Carlos Buell, pursues Bragg from the west
+++
### Perryville Battlefield Mapping
###### Background Information
- Knobs to the west of town provide high ground for defensive positions for Bragg's soldiers
- Bragg orders attack on Union positions, but Union army uses cloak of hilly terrain to surprise advancing Confederates. 
- Repeatedly, Union forces retreated before General Bragg's men and established new defensive lines on another ridge.
+++
### Perryville Battlefield Mapping
###### Background Information
- Depressions and hills were not obvious to soldiers during the battle and led to a series of tragic mistakes by commanders on both sides.
- Units found themselves in the midst of withering crossfire because the terrain had forced them into an unfavorable position.
- At the same time, this terrain led to a phenomenon called acoustic shadow. Union General Don Carlos Buell, hence, could not hear the battle from his headquarters and did not send vital reinforcements on time
+++
### Perryville Battlefield Terrain Analysis
- Using digital terrain data from LiDAR and UAS, recreate the setting of the battle:
 - How tall was the corn in early October? What was its impact on sightlines?
 - How tall and dense was the forest separating the battlefield from Buell's position to the West?
 - How many decibels are created by a 10 lb cannon? Under atmospheric conditions in early October?
 - Can we model the acoustic shadow? 
+++ 
### Perryville UAS Field Operations
- First large-scale mapping effort by UofL 
- 2 flights conducted on March 3rd, 2017.
- 60 acres mapped at a resolution of 2 cm
- High winds, cold temperatures, and equipment failures presented difficult conditions
- No ground control used, image EXIF data only

### Next Steps
- Refly area using ground control points for increased accuracy
- Process imagery in Pix4D Mapper Pro
- Derive historic vegetation characteristics from maps and texts
- Generate 3D model for terrain analysis
- Create series of 3D and timeenabled story maps for reinterpretation of battle

### UofL Stream Institute 
###### Stream Restoration Mapping
- Collaboration with Speed School Stream Institute
- Stream restoration projects design and build stream and wetland ecosystems
- Strip existing vegetation from site, dig/reinforce new stream channel, grade floodplain
- Miitigate erosion, promote healthy vegetation communities, aquatic life
+++

### UofL Stream Institute
###### Stream Restoration Mapping
- Improve process and add value for existing stream restoration project workflow
- UAS-derived "As Built" survey as substitute for time consuming and expensive ground survey
- Can low-cost UAS data provide accuracy necessary for precise engineering applications?
 - Horizontal and vertical accuracy of digital elevation product paramount
+++
### Early Efforts
- Moody Lane site in Oldham County
- Mission flown using a Blade QX4 UAV with a GoPro camera
- This combo does not encode coordinate information to image EXIF data
- Even with ground control, resulting image quality was lacking
- GPS navigation system also of poor reliability
